# Recaptured after executable formal plans began retaining the exact physical
# ClockDomain contract.  FormalDesign therefore has an explicit clock-domain
# tuple even when it is empty; this changes the durable eager-result surface,
# but not hardware, selected-IR, BackendArtifact, or production-RTL identity.
# Session-owned provider and tool-resolver handles remain represented by their
# stable role.  The values were independently compiled twice before being
# locked here.  File-backed cases were recaptured after the canonical source
# suffix changed from ``.zl`` to ``.zhl``: source-unit and physical-input
# provenance belong to this eager surface even though production RTL identity
# is unchanged.  Cases which publish selected/canonical value products were
# recaptured again for canonical schema v13, which retains conditional action
# activation predicates and scheduled scalar-output resources explicitly.  The
# present values also include the direct-production backend policy and the
# planning-owned scheduled-value/resource products; semantic typing no longer
# prematurely chooses pipeline placement before a target is known.  Each value
# below was independently compiled twice before being locked.
